                <h3>RV for everyone</h3>
                <p>Are you an RV Newbie? Top 5 things a new RVer should know when owning an RV!</p>

                <h3>5 Things you need to know</h3>
                <h6>1. You don’t need as much as you think.</h6>
                <p>If you wait until you are 100% ready…you’ll never go. In today’s day of gadgets and gismos you could start to feel overwhelmed and call the whole thing off. But don’t! Get your rig, some fuel and a good attitude because any RVer will tell you…your about to make memories of a lifetime! You won’t be a RV Newbie for long, so enjoy the feeling of anticipation.</p>
                <h6>2. Tires</h6>
                <p>If you’re buying a new RV (particularly a travel trailer or 5th wheel), it’s a good idea to check the date on your tires. Just because your rig is new doesn’t mean your tires are. Crazy right! There is usually a 4 digit number on the back of your tires to check when they were made. Have a peek.</p>
                <p>It’s also a good idea to lookup the weight of your RV and match on the tires load capacity PSI chart. Then you can find the proper PSI to ensure safety and a smooth ride.</p>
                <h6>3. Know your tanks</h6>
                <p>How much can you hold? How much can your fresh, gray, and black tanks hold is something every RVer figures out. Here is an insider tip…most likely your black and grey indicators will fail you at some point. Sorry. So after a few trips you should get a feel for how much your rig can hold and do some anticipatory math if you are going to Boondock for any length of time. Especially for your fresh water…more on that later.</p>
                <h6>4. Avoid Mistakes and Accidents</h6>
                <p>This might seem obvious, but it’s not in the moment. Slow down…and not just driving, in everything. Mistakes are more likely to happen when you are feeling rushed. There will be times when you feel like you need to be doing something faster or better but its just a feeling so let it sit in timeout. Enjoy the process. Slow down. <br> The party started when you left the house so no worries…one day you will be the expert and just smile at the new guy trying to figure out his sewer system…and because you are a seasoned RVer…you’ll be the first to pitch in and help…because that’s just the way RVers are…helpful!</p>
                <h6>5. Document</h6>
                <p>You will look back on these trips with fond memories. That is if you document them. Like Marc says, “If I don’t record it…it didn’t happen” ☺ Make sure your precious memories are time capsules by film, recording or journal.
                    <br>
                    Write down what you liked, didn’t, what when wrong, and what you loved. This way you have a point of reference for what to do next time. This way you are always getting better at this RVing thing.</p>
